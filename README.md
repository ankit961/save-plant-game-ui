## üéÆ Gameplay

The goal is to grow the plant from a tiny seed to a full-grown plant by managing resources and reacting to environmental conditions. Players must keep the plant‚Äôs **health** high, **growth** progressing, and **energy** in balance.

### Actions Available

   - Cooldown: 1 minute
2. **Fertilize**: Boosts growth rate.
   - Cooldown: 3 minutes
3. **Pest Spray**: Protects the plant from pest attacks.
   - Cooldown: 5 minutes
4. **Mulch**: Helps retain soil moisture, making the plant more drought-resistant.
   - Cooldown: 10 minutes
5. **Prune**: Pruning increases the growth of the plant slightly.
   - Cooldown: 7 minutes
6. **Shade Protection**: Only effective in hot weather, providing temporary relief to the plant.

### Key Objectives
